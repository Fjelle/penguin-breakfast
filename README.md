Framework to play the game of 'penguins'. Developed primarily to play test the game, but also to have a go on developing a neural-network AI later on.

The goal of the game is to earn money. The game ends when a player owns more money than the set goal, currently 30 pounds. The player with the most money at that point wins the game. Money is earned by investing in companies. Companies give a reward to the player that has invested most in a company. 
This game is played in two repeating phases. In phase one the players get to invest their money in several companies. Players know how much they invested in a company, but have little information as to what investments their opponent(s) made. Phase two is the reward phase. Each company has a certain value, which it rewards to the player that has invested most in that company. On a tie, no money is rewarded. Player are told which companies rewarded them, but not which companies rewarded their opponent(s) or which companies did not reward any player. After the reward phase, the game returns to the investment phase and the players are asked to invest their newly earned money. 

current status: the game works and is playable in my linux virtualbox. It now allows for more than two players. Sadly, play testing showed that the game is not very much fun at the moment. 

next step: improve communication by the game to players, change the rules to make the game fun to play, play test the game with friends some more, publish game on website, develop AI.
